Data Science Phase 1 Project (v3)
This is a comprehensive data analysis project where i will analyze aviation accident data to provide business recommendations. Here's how to approach it:

📊 Project Overview
This project is focused on transforming raw data into actionable insights for business decision-making. 
The project includes:​

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and preparing data for analysis.

Imputation: Filling in missing data using appropriate techniques.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables.

Modeling: Applying statistical models to understand data patterns.

Visualization: Creating plots and charts to communicate findings effectively.​


🧠 Business and Data Understanding
Stakeholder Audience: Business analysts and decision-makers seeking insights from data.

Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset containing :'Event.Id', 'Investigation.Type', 'Accident.Number', 'Event.Date','Location', 'Country', 'Latitude', 'Longitude', 'Airport.Code','Airport.Name', 'Injury.Severity', 'Aircraft.damage','Aircraft.Category', 'Registration.Number', 'Make', 'Model','Amateur.Built', 'Number.of.Engines', 'Engine.Type', 'FAR.Description','Schedule', 'Purpose.of.flight', 'Air.carrier', 'Total.Fatal.Injuries','Total.Serious.Injuries', 'Total.Minor.Injuries', 'Total.Uninjured'

Objective: To provide actionable insights that can inform business strategies and decisions.​


🛠️ Methodology
